\chapter{Typing Rules}
This appendix gives the explicit formal typing rules for 
input language, as well as notes on implicit conversion and casting.



\section{Types}

The main types recognised by  are as follows:

 
\section{Implicit Conversion}
There is only one kind of implicit convertion. 


\section{Type Rules}
The type rules are presented below with the operators on the left and
the signatures of the rules on the right. To save space, more than one
operator may be on the left-hand side, and it is also the case that an
individual operator may have more than one signature. For more information
on these expressions and their type rules see.
