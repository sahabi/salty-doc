Salty is a symbolic model checker originated from the
reengineering, reimplementation and extension of CMU , the
original BDD-based model checker developed at CMU \cite{McMil93}.
The Salty project aims at the development of a state-of-the-art
symbolic model checker, designed to be applicable in technology
transfer projects: it is a well structured, open, flexible and
documented platform for model checking, and is robust and close to
industrial systems standards \cite{CCGR00}.
